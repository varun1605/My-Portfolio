          <h2>Food ordering application using the live data from Syiggy API</h2>
          <p>
            In my food ordering application built with React.js, I seamlessly
            integrated swiggy.com's live API to provide users with real-time
            data. Utilizing React hooks like useState, useEffect, and
            useContext, I efficiently managed state and handled side effects. To
            enhance user experience, I implemented shimmer UI, ensuring smooth
            transitions and interactions. Styling components with Tailwind CSS,
            I achieved a modern and cohesive design throughout the application.
            This project highlights my dedication to delivering efficient and
            visually appealing web solutions.
